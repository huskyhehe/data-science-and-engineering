## About this course
Is your secret wish to become a good data analyst? Or maybe you are an artist or humanities or an accounting person who wants to use computer programming as a tool to get into data science? Or maybe you already know a good deal of programming and are looking to dive deep into numerical computation and data science engineering? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then DAMG 6105 is the course for you.  

DAMG 6105 is unique because it helps people who are totally new to programming get a friendly and fun introduction to programming with a pivot towards any kind of data analysis. For the more experienced, DAMG 6105 also provides advanced numerical computation material to prepare them for data science engineering.  

We use the Python programming language in this course for two reasons. One, Python is a high- level language that feels like English, almost. Two, you can get a lot done in Python by writing only very few lines to software code!

## What will you learn in this course?
### Basic material for beginners
1. Start programming in Python
2. How to input and output data in Python.
3. How to use Python to “scrape” data from webpages.
4. How to use Python to read data from excel worksheets and sql tables.
5. Store data in Python lists, tuples and dictionaries.
6. How to visualize data in Python in less than 5 lines of code.
7. What are functions and how to write them?
8. Regular expression and why you should be learning about them.
9. Getting Python to do the repetitive and conditional stuff (if, elif and for loops in Python)
10. Write Python in style: the PEP 8 style guide and why you really need to have style while coding!
### Advanced material
11. Learn tips and tricks for reading in large datasets into pandas.
12. Develop a deep understanding of built-in and abstract datatypes in Python and how one should leverage them for specific tasks.
13. Learn about numpy, scipy and pyTorch
14. Fundamentals of machine learning using the ever popular scikit-learn as toolkit.

## Course Syllabus
In addition to covering the material below, you are expected to work on a project. Students get to choose from either an instructor led project or, a properly thought-out student led project.  

Course introduction — structure, operations, components, and content overview. Why Python over other languages? Brief introduction to Python, and an overview of Python libraries commonly used by data scientists.  

Exploring the power of pandas to read data from multiple formats. Basic and advanced pandas operations with specific emphasis on numerical computation.
Data structures in Python: built-in and abstract. Which data structures are suitable for large-scale numerical computation and why? The problem of search and how different data structures hack it.  

Python numpy and scipy. The use of optimized Python libraries to enable fast numerical compute. Some examples of input-output, web scraping and regular expressions.    

Python and machine learning: stochastic gradient descent as the basis for a majority of ML algorithms and its implementation. Decision trees and Random Forests. Using Python to create a random forest classifier on a simple dataset. What does a complete machine learning pipeline in scikit-learn look like?What are its essential components? From data preprocessing to ML model performance evaluation.

Data visualization packages in Python and their efficiency: matplotlib, seaborn and Bokeh (interactive visualization). Tips and tricks to machine learn on large datasets. Memory efficient computations.  

From prototyping to productizing in Python: considerations.
